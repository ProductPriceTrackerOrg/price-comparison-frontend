# Infinite Loop Fix - Retailer Products Page

## Problem:

The Retailer Products page was causing an infinite loop of API calls to `/api/v1/retailers/{id}/products`, leading to excessive server load and preventing the page from rendering properly.

## Root Causes:

1. `priceRange` was in the useEffect dependency array, causing re-renders when it changed
2. Setting `priceRange` in response to API data was creating a circular dependency
3. No debounce on price range slider movements
4. No protection against concurrent API requests
5. No cleanup for unmounted components

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Removed Circular Dependencies

- Removed `priceRange` from the useEffect dependency array
- Added a `isFirstLoad` ref to track initial price range initialization
- Fixed conditional logic for price range updates

### 2. Added Request Protection

- Implemented an `activeRequestRef` to prevent concurrent API calls
- Added proper cleanup of request flags after completion/error
- Added protection against state updates in unmounted components

### 3. Improved UI Interactions

- Modified the price range slider to only fetch data when the user finishes sliding
- Enhanced the search input to only trigger fetch on form submission
- Added explicit fetch calls on user interactions instead of relying on effect dependencies

### 4. Fixed Product Interface

- Updated the Product interface to match requirements for ProductCard
- Added proper mapping of API data to ensure required fields are present

### 5. Other Improvements

- Added proper reference cleanup on component unmount
- Enhanced error handling for API requests

## Results:

- The page now renders properly without infinite API calls
- User interactions with filters work as expected
- Data is fetched only when needed
- Component handles mounting/unmounting correctly

This fix demonstrates the importance of careful management of useEffect dependencies and state updates in React applications, especially when dealing with API calls triggered by state changes.
