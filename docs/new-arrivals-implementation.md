# New Arrivals Page Implementation

## Overview

The New Arrivals page (`/new-arrivals`) displays recently added products to the platform. This implementation follows the same patterns established for the price-drops page and integrates seamlessly with your PricePulse design system.

## Files Created

### Core Components

1. **`app/new-arrivals/page.tsx`** - Main new arrivals page component (197 lines)
2. **`app/new-arrivals/loading.tsx`** - Loading state component (75 lines)
3. **`components/new-arrivals/new-arrival-filters.tsx`** - Filters component (91 lines)
4. **`lib/types/new-arrivals.ts`** - TypeScript types based on database schema (39 lines)

## Features Implemented

### 📊 Statistics Dashboard

- Total number of new arrivals
- Average price of new products
- Number of products in stock
- Number of categories with new arrivals

### 🔍 Advanced Filtering

- **Time Range**: Last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 3 months
- **Category**: Filter by product categories (Smartphones, Laptops, Gaming, etc.)
- **Retailer**: Filter by specific retailers
- **Price Range**: Slider to set min/max price range ($0-$5000)
- **Stock Status**: Toggle to show only in-stock products
- **Sorting**: Newest/Oldest first, Price (Low/High), Name (A-Z/Z-A)

### 💳 Product Cards

Each new arrival card displays:

- Product image with hover effects
- **Green "NEW" badge** with sparkles icon
- **Arrival date badge** showing time since arrival (Today, Yesterday, Xd ago)
- Current price (no original price comparison)
- Retailer information
- Stock availability
- Action buttons (Track, Share, View)

### 🔄 Interactive Features

- **Favorite/Track Products**: Users can track products (requires login)
- **Share Products**: Native sharing or copy link to clipboard
- **External Links**: Direct links to retailer product pages
- **Error Handling**: Retry functionality for failed API calls

## Database Integration

### API Endpoints (To Be Implemented)

Based on your schema, the following API endpoints should be created:

```
GET /api/new-arrivals
- Query params: timeRange, category, retailer, minPrice, maxPrice, sortBy, inStockOnly, limit, page
- Returns: NewArrivalResponse[]

GET /api/categories
- Returns: Category[]

GET /api/retailers
- Returns: Retailer[]
```

### Database Queries

The backend should query the following tables:

- `DimCanonicalProduct` & `DimVariant` - For product information and creation dates
- `FactProductPrice` - For current pricing and availability
- `DimShop` - For retailer details
- `DimCategory` - For product categories

### Sample Query Structure

```sql
SELECT
    v.variant_id,
    cp.canonical_product_id,
    cp.product_title,
    cp.brand,
    c.category_name,
    v.variant_title,
    s.shop_name,
    fp.current_price,
    fp.original_price,
    v.image_url,
    v.product_url,
    fp.is_available,
    v.created_date as arrival_date,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, v.created_date) as days_since_arrival
FROM DimVariant v
JOIN DimCanonicalProduct cp ON v.canonical_product_id = cp.canonical_product_id
JOIN DimCategory c ON cp.category_id = c.category_id
JOIN DimShop s ON v.shop_id = s.shop_id
JOIN FactProductPrice fp ON v.variant_id = fp.variant_id AND fp.date_id = (
    SELECT MAX(date_id) FROM FactProductPrice WHERE variant_id = v.variant_id
)
WHERE v.created_date >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_DATE) -- Last 30 days
-- Add filtering conditions based on query parameters
ORDER BY v.created_date DESC -- Newest first
```

## Design Features

### 🎨 Visual Design

- **Green gradient background** (green-50/30 to blue-50/30) vs red for price drops
- **Green theme**: Green badges, icons, and accents
- **Dual badges**: NEW badge (left) + arrival date badge (right)
- Card-based layout with hover effects
- Responsive grid layout (1-4 columns based on screen size)

### 📱 Mobile Responsive

- Responsive grid: 1 column on mobile, up to 4 on desktop
- Touch-friendly buttons and interactions
- Optimized spacing and typography
- Collapsible filter controls

### 🎯 Badge System

- **NEW Badge**: Green background with sparkles icon
- **Date Badge**: White background showing arrival time
- **Stock Status**: Built into ProductCard component
- **Categories**: Color-coded category tags

## Integration Points

### Layout Components

- **Header**: Logo, authentication, admin access
- **NavigationBar**: Horizontal navigation with "New Arrivals" highlighted
- **Footer**: Company information and links
- **Breadcrumb**: Home > New Arrivals navigation

### Component Reuse

- **ProductCard**: Same component used across site for consistency
- **Filters**: Modular filter component for easy maintenance
- **Loading States**: Skeleton components matching actual layout

### Data Transformation

```tsx
const transformToProduct = (arrival: NewArrivalResponse) => ({
  id: arrival.variant_id,
  name: arrival.product_title,
  brand: arrival.brand,
  category: arrival.category_name,
  price: arrival.current_price,
  originalPrice: arrival.original_price,
  retailer: arrival.shop_name,
  inStock: arrival.is_available,
  image: arrival.image_url,
  isNew: true,
  launchDate: arrival.arrival_date,
});
```

## Mock Data Examples

### Product Categories

- Smartphones, Laptops, Audio, Monitors, Tablets, Accessories, Gaming, Wearables

### Sample Products

- iPhone 16 Pro, MacBook Pro M4, Samsung Galaxy Watch 7
- Sony PlayStation 5 Pro, ASUS ROG Gaming Laptop, Meta Quest 4

### Price Range

- $329.99 (smartwatch) to $2,899.99 (gaming laptop)
- Different retailers and availability status

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features

- Component code splitting (under 200 lines per file)
- Efficient filtering and sorting algorithms
- Lazy loading for images
- Skeleton loading states for better UX

### Future Enhancements
