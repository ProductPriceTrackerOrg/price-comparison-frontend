# Socket Hang Up Error Fix Summary

## Problem

API routes in the application were experiencing "socket hang up" errors, which occur when a connection is unexpectedly terminated before the response is received.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced API Client Configuration**:

   - Added `axios-retry` for automatic retry logic
   - Configured with exponential backoff for retries
   - Increased timeout from 10s to 15s
   - Added proper TypeScript types

2. **Centralized Error Handling**:

   - Created `lib/error-handling.ts` with a shared `handleApiError` function
   - Implemented specific handling for different error types:
     - Socket hang ups
     - Connection timeouts
     - Connection refusals
     - Network errors
     - Backend server errors

3. **Improved API Route Handlers**:

   - Updated route handlers to use the centralized error handling
   - Added better logging with context information
   - Implemented specific HTTP status codes for different error types
   - Added graceful fallbacks for non-critical features

4. **Special Case Handling**:

   - For the chat API, maintained fallback response generation
   - For autocomplete search, implemented a graceful degradation strategy

5. **Documentation**:
   - Created `docs/api-error-handling.md` with detailed implementation guide
   - Added explanations of error types and how to handle them

## Files Modified

- `lib/api.ts` - Added retry logic and improved error handling
- `lib/chat-api.ts` - Added retry logic and improved error handling
- `lib/error-handling.ts` - New file for centralized error handling
- `app/api/v1/retailers/[id]/products/route.ts` - Updated to use central error handler
- `app/api/v1/top-deals/deals/route.ts` - Updated to use central error handler
- `app/api/v1/chat/route.ts` - Enhanced error handling while maintaining fallbacks
- `app/api/v1/search/autocomplete/route.ts` - Switched to use API client and added graceful degradation

## Benefits

- More resilient API routes that can handle connection issues
- Consistent error handling across all API routes
- Better user experience with graceful degradation
- Improved logging for troubleshooting
- Proper error responses with meaningful status codes
- Automatic retries for transient failures

## Next Steps

Apply similar error handling to other API routes in the application following the documented approach.
