# Price Drops Page Implementation

## Overview
The Price Drops page (`/price-drops`) displays products that have recently experienced price reductions. This implementation is based on your database schema and follows the design patterns established in your PricePulse frontend.

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Components
1. **`app/price-drops/page.tsx`** - Main price drops page component
2. **`app/price-drops/loading.tsx`** - Loading state for the page
3. **`components/product/price-drop-card.tsx`** - Individual price drop card component
4. **`lib/types/price-drops.ts`** - TypeScript types based on your database schema

## Features Implemented

### üìä Statistics Dashboard
- Total number of price drops
- Average discount percentage
- Number of retailers with drops
- Number of categories with drops

### üîç Advanced Filtering
- **Time Range**: Last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 3 months
- **Category**: Filter by product categories (Smartphones, Laptops, etc.)
- **Retailer**: Filter by specific retailers
- **Minimum Discount**: Slider to set minimum discount percentage
- **Sorting**: By discount percentage or amount, recent drops

### üí≥ Product Cards
Each price drop card displays:
- Product image with hover effects
- Price drop percentage badge
- Current vs previous price
- Retailer information
- Stock availability
- Time since price drop
- Action buttons (Track, Share, View)

### üîÑ Interactive Features
- **Favorite/Track Products**: Users can track products (requires login)
- **Share Products**: Native sharing or copy link to clipboard
- **External Links**: Direct links to retailer product pages
- **Error Handling**: Retry functionality for failed API calls

## Database Integration

### API Endpoints (To Be Implemented)
Based on your schema, the following API endpoints should be created:

```
GET /api/price-drops
- Query params: timeRange, category, retailer, minDiscount, sortBy, limit, page
- Returns: PriceDropResponse[]

GET /api/categories
- Returns: Category[]

GET /api/retailers  
- Returns: Retailer[]

POST /api/user/favorites
- Body: { variant_id: number }
- Adds product to user's tracked products

DELETE /api/user/favorites
- Body: { variant_id: number }
- Removes product from user's tracked products
```

### Database Queries
The backend should query the following tables:
- `FactProductPrice` - For current and historical pricing
- `DimCanonicalProduct` & `DimVariant` - For product information
- `DimShop` - For retailer details
- `DimCategory` - For product categories
- `UserFavorites` - For user tracking functionality

### Sample Query Structure
```sql
SELECT 
    v.variant_id,
    cp.canonical_product_id,
    cp.product_title,
    cp.brand,
    c.category_name,
    v.variant_title,
    s.shop_name,
    fp_current.current_price,
    fp_previous.current_price as previous_price,
    (fp_current.current_price - fp_previous.current_price) as price_change,
    ((fp_current.current_price - fp_previous.current_price) / fp_previous.current_price * 100) as percentage_change,
    fp_current.date_id as drop_date,
    v.image_url,
    v.product_url,
    fp_current.is_available,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, fp_current.date_id) as days_since_drop
FROM DimVariant v
JOIN DimCanonicalProduct cp ON v.canonical_product_id = cp.canonical_product_id
JOIN DimCategory c ON cp.category_id = c.category_id
JOIN DimShop s ON v.shop_id = s.shop_id
JOIN FactProductPrice fp_current ON v.variant_id = fp_current.variant_id
JOIN FactProductPrice fp_previous ON v.variant_id = fp_previous.variant_id
WHERE fp_current.current_price < fp_previous.current_price
AND fp_current.date_id > fp_previous.date_id
-- Add filtering conditions based on query parameters
ORDER BY percentage_change ASC -- or other sorting options
```

## Design Features

### üé® Visual Design
- Modern gradient background
- Card-based layout with hover effects
- Color-coded badges for discounts and stock status
- Responsive grid layout (1-4 columns based on screen size)
- Skeleton loading states

### üì± Mobile Responsive
- Responsive grid: 1 column on mobile, up to 4 on desktop
- Touch-friendly buttons and interactions
- Optimized spacing and typography

### ‚ôø Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color scheme
- Screen reader compatible

## Integration Points

### Authentication Context
- Uses existing `useAuth()` hook
- Handles login-required features appropriately
- Shows different UI states for logged-in vs guest users

### Toast Notifications
- Success/error messages for user actions
- Uses existing `useToast()` hook
- Provides feedback for favorites and sharing

### Navigation
- Integrates with existing navigation bar
- Uses Next.js Link components for internal navigation
- Maintains consistent routing patterns

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- Image lazy loading
- Virtualized scrolling for large datasets (can be added)
- Debounced filter updates
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo (can be added)

### Caching Strategy
- API responses can be cached
- Static filter data (categories, retailers) cached
- User preferences stored in localStorage

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
1. **Price Alerts**: Email/push notifications for tracked products
2. **Price History Charts**: Inline mini-charts in cards
3. **Comparison View**: Side-by-side price comparisons
4. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple products for tracking
5. **Export Features**: CSV/PDF export of price drops
6. **Advanced Analytics**: Price prediction indicators

### Data Visualizations
- Price drop trends over time
- Category-wise discount analysis
- Retailer comparison charts
- Seasonal price patterns

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering with different props
- Filter logic functionality
- User interaction handling
- API error scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Full page functionality
- Authentication flows
- API integration
- Navigation between pages

### E2E Tests
- Complete user journeys
- Filter and search functionality
- Responsive design validation
- Performance testing

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=your-api-base-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
```

### Build Optimization
- Enable image optimization in next.config.js
- Configure proper caching headers
- Implement code splitting for better performance

This implementation provides a solid foundation that can be extended with additional features and optimizations as your platform grows.
